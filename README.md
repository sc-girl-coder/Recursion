# Recursion
 Program will generate an array at a user declared size with  random integer number elements. The program will then run a few functions  which utilize recursion to: print the array, print the array backwards,  find the powers of 1 to the first element of the array, find the power of an  elements, and finally, determine if the elements in an array are prime.
